name: "The Navy Seal copypasta, also sometimes known as Gorilla Warfare per a misspelling of \"guerrilla warfare\" in its contents, is an aggressive but humorous attack paragraph supposedly written by an extremely well-trained member of the United States Navy SEALs (hence its name) to an unidentified \"kiddo\", ostensibly whoever the copypasta is directed to. Written in a manner similar to a non-serious death threat, the copypasta has the author threaten the recipient while boasting of their own increasingly absurd or unfeasible accomplishments, such as having \"over 300 confirmed kills\" or being able to kill someone \"in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands\". This copypasta is often reposted as a humorous overreaction to an insult and is thought to have originated on the military-themed imageboard OperatorChan, in a post dated 11 November 2010.[4]\r\n\r\nIn 2019, the copypasta appeared in the manifesto of the perpetrator of the Christchurch mosque shootings, causing some news sources to report the claims at face value.[5]"
