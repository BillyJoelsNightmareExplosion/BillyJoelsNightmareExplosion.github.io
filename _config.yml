# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  My personal website.
  If you're here to evaluate my coding/tech art work and experience, take a look at my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a>.
  Otherwise, I write stuff and film stuff and make music and food and like to clean
  my room and I'm gonna try to put my stuff here so I can stand back and look at it
  while no one visits so I can be content and alone. Come to think of it,
  I can't stand back too far or else I'll have to make the text scaling larger.
  It's probably for the best that I stay seated.
baseurl: # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
