## pancakes

- 125-150 g flour
    - add more at the end for thickness
- 2 tablespoons organic sugar (20 - 30 g)
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
    - if the batter bubbles that’s a good sign, too much doesn’t seem to hurt
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 230 g soymilk, water is less tasty but still fine (do slightly less)
- do a lot butter in the pan for a crispy fatty top because life is short
- don't burn them (I always burn them)
